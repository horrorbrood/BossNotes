Once it activates, triggering it will do near-fatal personal damage and heavy raid-wide damage.\n  - Destructive Resonance (Displacement): Mine grows bigger before expiring.\n  - Destructive Resonance (Fortification): Mine persists for two minutes, instead of one.\n  - Destructive Resonance (Replication): Mine will create two additional mines when it expires.\n\n++Ability 2: Branded++\nA debuff that jumps from player to player in the raid every 4 seconds, damaging the player it jumped from. Starts with 12 stacks, increases damage and loses range for every jump. Players receiving Branded with 8 stacks or fewer should move away from the raid to force it to expire.\n\nBranded (Displacement): Players with Branded cannot move more than 10 yards. Raid must move away from player to allow it to clear.\n  - Branded (Fortification): Range loss from jumping decreased. Player should not attempt to force it to expire until 3-4 stacks; players will take very heavy damage from jumps at low stack counts.\n  - Branded (Replication): Two stacks of Branded go out; strategy is otherwise unchanged.\n\n++Ability 3: Arcane Aberration++\nAdd picked up by off-tank that does light raidwide AoE damage.\n  - Aberration (Displacement): Aberration has a knockback when it dies. Position accordingly.\n  - Aberration (Fortification): Aberration has a much larger healthpool, and becomes immune to CC. No change to strategy.\n  - Aberration (Replication): Aberration will spawn several Arcane Remnants when it dies, which must be AoE'd.\n\n++Ability 4: Mark of Chaos++\nAn 8 second debuff applied to the current tank which kills anyone within 35 yards on expiration. The debuffed tank should run away from the raid, the offtank should taunt, and all raid members run away from the debuffed tank.\n  - Mark of Chaos (Displacement): Affected tank is randomly teleported when debuff is applied.\n  - Mark of Chaos (Fortification): Tank is rooted. Raid must use movement speed abilities to run away.\n  - Mark of Chaos (Replication): When Mark of Chaoe explodes, 8 highly-damaging orbs fly out from the tank. Avoid.\n\n++Ability 5: Force Nova++\nA wave that emanates from Mar'gok and does heavy damage. Players should run towards Mar'gok to cross wave faster and reduce damage taken.\n  - Force Nova (Displacement): Nova will slow crossers, requiring a movement-speed buff to reduce damage taken.\n  - Force Nova (Fortification): Three Novas will occur over 16 seconds. Damage reduction or healing cooldowns may be necessary.\n  - Force Nova (Replication): Players will replicate damage taken by Force Nova to other players within 4 yards. Spread out while crossing.\n\n++Intermissions: Adds++\nThere are two intermissions at 55% and 20% HP where Mar'gok is unattackable and adds spawn. Kill adds in this order:\n  - Gorian Warmage: 2 per intermission, untankable, constantly casts spells at random raid members.\n  - Volatile Anomaly: Multiple spawn during intermission, should be picked up by tanks and kept away from Warmages.
